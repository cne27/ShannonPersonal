            <p>Hello! I’m Shannon, a marine scientist and second-year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University. I am dedicated to making a positive difference through science by using environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques to monitor and measure biodiversity in coastal ecosystems. My research focuses on nature-based solutions that enhance biodiversity and restore coastal habitats.</p>
            <p>As an aspiring marine ecologist, I combine my love for research with public education and outreach. I am passionate about communicating scientific knowledge to diverse audiences and inspiring others to take part in conservation efforts.</p>

            <article class="research-item">
                <h3>Potential Impacts of Deepwater Horizon Oil on Gulf Toadfish</h3>
                <p>Shannon conducted research on the effects of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, which released over 800 million liters of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Her research focused on the Gulf toadfish (<em>Opsanus beta</em>) and investigated how polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the oil spill impact the stress response in these marine organisms.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To quantify the pituitary surface area and perimeters of Gulf toadfish exposed to DWH oil for 28 days under control and high PAH concentrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Long-term exposure to PAHs decreased cortisol levels and led to pituitary atrophy in Gulf toadfish. Atrophied pituitary glands showed a reduced surface area, indicating a potential disruption in thyroid hormone synthesis and increased pituitary activity to compensate for stress responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Directions:</strong> Investigating the ecological consequences of DWH oil exposure on fish population dynamics, specifically focusing on recruitment rates and the overall health of marine ecosystems.</li>
                </ul>

            <article class="research-item">
                <h3>Developing a Pipeline for Environmental DNA Detection of Cnidarian Communities</h3>
                <p>Shannon collaborated with Dr. Julie Lockwood’s team to develop a cost-effective pipeline for detecting cnidarian communities using environmental DNA (eDNA). This project aims to enhance biodiversity monitoring in coastal New Jersey.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish a DNA reference library of cnidarians, identify DNA regions that differentiate between species, and create an efficient method for extracting DNA from cnidarian tissues and water samples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> The team used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to process eDNA samples and developed a reliable process for identifying various species, including invasive ones like jellyfish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> eDNA methods allow for the detection of species without the need for physical capture, making monitoring more accessible, cost-effective, and scalable. The cnidarian pipeline can be used to track population shifts and the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems.</li>
                </ul>
